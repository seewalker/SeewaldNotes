Conceptual Discussion:
   *In general, the absence of some marker should not convey meaning because absence
   is usually harder to notice than presence. It is, however, attractive in the planning
   stage, so a few important exceptions can be made. For example the absence of `*' in
   sentences means less locality (more relevant to all items of the group).
   *Thinking is broader than ordinary programming languages, so Seewald Notes will probably
   never have a compiler. The interpreter is the human brain, which is better at certain
   types of high-ambiguity reasoning. Since there is not intended to be a compiler,
   content with multiple interpretations is possible. `#In some situations this duplicity
   is desireable (e.g. jokes), and in some situations this duplicity is undesirable (e.g.
   trying to get a point across). Because there is no compiler, there is also more tolerance
   for misuses of Seewald Notes `# although they still suck #'.
   *Non-heavily sigiled or modal content is called `text'. It conforms more closely to
   <natural language> semantics. Programming languages often use whitespace to separate
   tokens, whereas natural language tokens (e.g. Free Parking) often span over spaces.
   The use of camelcase is to cast natural-language-esque spans as programming language
   spans, so there is no need to use camelcase within < > blocks.
   *The sorting of content under headers is inexact in respect to the best `/way(s)?/' of
   thinking about it. The groupings are more a product of how the author is currently
   thinking and best able to express those thoughts.

*Data Types:
    Like how arrays are the fundamental datatype of c and how s-expressions are the
    fundamental datatype of lisps, the tree is the fundamental datatype of Seewald
    notes. The name is the file is conceptually the root header. The .swd extension
    marks the file as of Seewald note grammar, as opposed to .py or .tar files.
    *Wiki syntax, at least that used in wiki.cs.earlham.edu, uses `*' to designate
    subitems of a header. When a sentence under a header is not prefaced by a `*',
    its content is assumed to be relevant to all items in the list (less locality).

*Modal Regions:
    Latex uses ` ' as single quote and `` '' as double quote. In this tradition, I use
    `? ?' to enclose questions to return to. `! <text> !' marks answers to the question.
    The answer to a question has the same tree depth as the question, v.i.z the answer
    is not a child of the question, it directly follows the question.
        `?What is the difference between a question mode and a sentence which ends with
        a question mark? Question sentences are questions which are of the text. In other
        words, the question is the point. Question modes relate to more meta matters about
        the topic and are intended to be answered with an answer mode.
    *Unix uses ~ as home, so `~ ~' encloses terms with special meaning within the jargon
    context of the topic at hand. This topic may be explicit or implicit.
    *# is a prefix that marks a comment in many programming languages. I this tradition,
    I use `# <text> #' to enclose a region of text that the author considers to be more
    subjective.
        `? What is the difference between `#<text>#' regions and (<text>)? I don't know,
        but I feel that there is a difference ?'.
        `! ( <text> ) regions are commentary that I consider more factual than
        `# <text> #' regions (which are more murky|intimate)!'.
    *In common speech, there is a distinction between using a word and referencing a word.
    Using words is considered the default mode and referencing a word, or phrase, is
    enclosed by ` '. From the traditon of Latex.
    *`/ /' is regular expression mode. This is useful for situtations where simple text
    reasons are not precisely descriptive enough to taste. (I know this shadows c-style
    multiple line comment mode, but it resembles s/<target>/<replacement> regular
    expressions a-la */perl|sed|vimL/*.
    *Headers, e.g. `Modal Regions' in this sentence's header, are followed by a colon.
    *<identifier> ::= <Explanation of idea>. From the BNF tradition.
    *(<non-essential commentary>). As in the english language, parenthesis
    enclose commentary on one's writing which has a degree of separation from
    the text itself. Reflecting the fact that words themselves have some degree
    of separation from reality, reality itself can be considered parenthesis level
    zero, .swd files (or I would consider most non-meta communication) are of
    parenthesis level one. In the recursive tradition of computer science, infinite
    nesting of parenthesis is possible and sometimes a good idea, `#but sometimes
    annoying if people get carried away with it #'.
    *As in the english language sentences begin with capital letters or non-text
    content and end with periods.

*Explanations:
    *Latex uses $ <text> $ to enclose a mathematics mode because people often use latex
    for mathematics, so quickness of entering and exiting the mode is an opporunity for
    much time savings.
    *`? What should the role of whitespace be?':
    *Why do ` ' enclose the supplementary characters [#?!.*] rather than a ` `? '?' ordering?
    Having ` ' yields a symmetry.

*Vocabulary:
    *sentence ::= an item under a header that is not itself a header. This sentence
    itself is an example, but a `*' sigil need not be present for membership in the
    set of sentences.
    *global tree ::= a word referencing the tree whose root is a file on a filesystem.
    For example `noteFormat.swd' (this file).
    *universal tree ::= the root of the filesystem.

*Arbitary Choices:
    *I named Seewald Notes, and the accompanying abbreviation in the file extension
    .swd, after myself. This naming is not deep; I predict that I am the only person
    to likely ever use this note taking structure so `Seewald' seems descriptive. If
    anybody else ever adopts this structure, which I would consider a huge honor, the
    name ought to be changed.

*To Do:
    *Vim plugin for Seewald notes:
        *Highlighting:

*Issues:
    *I used the word `sentence' in contradictory ways in this document.
    `? Sentence is clearly a technical word in Seewald Notes context, so I need
       to decide what exactly it means ?'.
    *I like it how perl allows any character to be the separator between search
    and replace regions of search and replace constructs where the choice of charcter
    is inferred by the first one used. I should be mindful of how to incorperate something
    like that here.
*Other:
    *If there is an Other node, it should be the last node of a subtree. E.g.
    this section is the global tree. Since every header is the node of a subtree,
    `Other' sections may be children of a non-global header.
